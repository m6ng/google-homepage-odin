# google-homepage-odin
This project is to replicate the look of the Google homepage with just HTML and CSS. This should demonstrate skills that I understand the basics of HTML and CSS, while potentially utilizing principles of responsive design along the way.

# Challenges Encountered
List of notable obstacles / challenges that I have resolved in this project
* How to organize the content so that there is a header / middle section / footer? The use of CSS Grid makes it easy to organize the main sections together.
* How to make the links spaced out? I used properties of the CSS Flexbox in order to make them spaced out.
* How to make the search bar look like it has borders outside of the box? I had to make sure there was no border and have to warp things inside div's in order to create the structure I desire.
* How to make the footer responsive (i.e. how to make the footer change size and move its elements based on the browser width)? I had to dive into the properties of CSS Grid in order to make the footer responsive.
